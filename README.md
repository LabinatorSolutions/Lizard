# LTChess
~Mostly~ Completely functional C# chess engine.

Creating this in my spare time, and mostly using it to learn more about optimization and computer games, and uploading it here so I can keep backups of it and not lose it when my laptop finally dies.

Using [Aspiration Windows](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Aspiration_Windows), [Futility Pruning](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Futility_Pruning), [Delta Pruning](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Delta_Pruning), [Late Move Reductions](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Late_Move_Reductions), and most recently [Null Move Pruning](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Null_Move_Pruning).

Currently playing a bit above 1700 rating on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/LTChessBot), feel free to challenge it when it's online!
